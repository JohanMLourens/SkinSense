# SkinSense
 Honours 616 AI Project

This project was given to us at the beginning of the semester (2024). We were given the task of developing an AI model throughout the semester and presenting our project at the end of the semester. 

We chose to develop a model that could classify different types of skin cancer. We made use of the HAM-10000 dataset to train the model. Of the 7 types of skin cancer the dataset contained we decided to only classify the 3 main types of skin cancer.
We trained 4 different models using different frameworks. We made use of CNN, ResNet, VGG, and Inception. After getting the results from these models and seeing how they performed we decided to focus on using ResNet and CNN.
